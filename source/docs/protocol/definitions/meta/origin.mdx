# Origin

The `origin` object is a lightweight structure that describes **where** a piece of data or request **originated** from. While currently included for metadata and audit purposes, it is designed to support **future federation and multi-server communication**.

---

## Structure

An origin has two fields:

<SchemaExample path="/meta/origin.json">
```json Example
{
    "host": "example.com",
    "port": 443
}
```
</SchemaExample>

---

## Purpose

While currently not validated or enforced in any strict way, the `origin` field:

- Marks the **source location** of a message or object
- Prepares for **federated server-to-server communications**
- May be used by moderation tools or diagnostic utilities

---

## Trust Model

At present, the `origin` field is **informational only** and should not be trusted unless:

- It is verified by a **trusted server signature**, or
- The enclosing object is part of a **signed and authenticated context**
