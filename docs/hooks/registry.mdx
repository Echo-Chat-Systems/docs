# Hooks Registry

The Echo Hooks Registry is a community-curated listing of hook modules that have been published for broader use across
guilds, channels, and servers. It acts as a shared trust layer: while anyone can write and host their own hooks
independently, those listed in the registry benefit from enhanced visibility, shared infrastructure, and a structured
reputation system.

## Purpose of the Registry

The registry exists to solve several challenges that emerge in decentralized hook systems:

- **Discoverability**: Without a central index, high-quality, reusable hooks are difficult to find and reuse.
- **Trust**: Hooks execute code on the server—if not audited or known, they pose risks. Registry membership signals peer-reviewed safety.
- **Accountability**: The registry makes it possible to track authorship, historical versions, and usage patterns, which encourages responsible development.

By participating in the registry, hook developers gain visibility and infrastructure support, while users and server
operators gain a layer of assurance and community oversight.

## Registration and Hosting

Any hook can be submitted to the registry. Upon submission, it undergoes a brief automated review for basic contract
compliance (e.g. correct exports, valid hook metadata, size and resource limits).

Hooks accepted into the registry are:

- **Hosted centrally** at `registry.echo-chat.au/hooks/{namespace}`.
- **Versioned** automatically and immutably.
- **Signed** with the registry key for integrity verification.
- **Indexed** for lookup via the Echo server admin interface or API.

While registry hosting is encouraged, it is not required. Servers are free to load hooks from any valid URL. However,
only registry-hosted hooks are eligible for trust scoring and governance votes.

## Trust Scoring and Governance

Echo's registry integrates with the same **reputation-based consensus system** used in other areas of the protocol,
such as [user trust scoring](/docs/protocol/definitions/user/reputation).

Once a hook is registered:

- **Users** and **server operators** who have used the hook may rate or flag it.
- Hooks can **gain or lose trust** over time based on usage and feedback.
- A hook with consistently low trust may become **flagged**, triggering a community vote.

The registry is governed by a lightweight voting protocol. If a registered hook is believed to be harmful, misleading,
or malicious, users can initiate a vote to:

- **Ban** a hook from being served via the registry.
- **Revoke** a developer's authoring privileges (if abuse is recurring or egregious).

These votes are weighted based on participant reputation, and quorum thresholds prevent spammy or biased takeovers.

## Author Reputation

Every registered hook must declare an author or maintainer. Authors themselves accumulate a **registry reputation score** based on:

- Number of accepted hooks
- Hook usage volume
- Feedback ratings and trust metrics
- Participation in governance actions

An author with consistently poor scores may be prevented from registering new hooks or may have their existing ones
disabled. This encourages responsible stewardship of public hooks and deters spam or malicious usage.

Community actions are final and only reversible through a direct appeal to the registry host, who can review the case
and potentially reinstate a hook or author if warranted, however community votes are strongly weighted and only
reversed in circumstances of clear error or abuse.

## Benefits of Registration

Choosing to register a hook is **optional**, but comes with significant upsides:

- **Registry Hosting**: Automatic caching and availability via CDN
- **Visibility**: Hooks are listed in official search tools
- **Auditability**: Others can review and verify the hook’s logic and security
- **Trust Marking**: Registered hooks can be opted into by users more confidently
- **Version Tracking**: Hook changes are recorded and accessible via an audit trail

Unregistered hooks can still be loaded by a server, but must be hosted externally and do not benefit from any of the
above systems.
