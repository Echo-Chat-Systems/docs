# Post-Execute Hooks

Post-execute hooks are executed only after a server action has completed and the response has been sent back to the
client. Unlike pre-execute hooks, these hooks cannot modify the message or response—they are purely observational and
are intended for use cases that require **auditing**, **analytics**, or **external system integration**.

This separation of concerns—between mutation and observation—ensures that post-execute hooks cannot interfere with the
normal behavior of the system, while still enabling reactive behaviors based on activity.

## Use Cases and Capabilities

The primary motivation behind post-execute hooks is to allow external systems to be notified of events occurring within
Echo. For example, a guild administrator might configure a hook that logs every `send-message` event to an analytics
platform, or a user might opt into a system that tracks usage statistics for their own account.

To support these scenarios, post-execute hooks are permitted to make outbound HTTP requests to public endpoints.
These requests can include contextual information about the action that occurred, such as the actor, the message
payload, and the result of the action.

## User Consent and Safety

Because post-execute hooks can leak sensitive user data to third-party systems via HTTP, they are considered
**privacy-sensitive**. To protect user autonomy, Echo enforces a strict opt-in model: any user must explicitly
grant permission for post-execute hooks to be run on actions that **originate from them**.

This model allows community-driven features like public statistics or badge systems to be built consensually,
without sacrificing the privacy guarantees that Echo is designed to uphold.

A hook manifest must contain a declaration stating exactly what the hook does and what data it will send out. These
declarations are presented to users individually when they first encounter a post-execute hook, and they must
affirmatively agree to allow the hook to run. Users can later revoke this consent at any time, preventing the hook from
running on future actions.

There is also an existing [hooks registry](/docs/hooks/registry/) that allows users to discover and
review available hooks, including their descriptions and the data they will transmit. This registry is separate from the
main Echo system and is maintained by the community, ensuring that users can make informed decisions about which
hooks to enable.

## Error Handling and Isolation

Post-execute hooks are fully decoupled from the user request flow. They are run asynchronously and have no impact on the
success or failure of the original request. Any errors raised during hook execution are logged, but never propagated to
the user or to other systems.

This ensures that hooks do not introduce instability or latency into the client experience. Failed HTTP requests,
runtime errors, or timeouts are silently handled unless explicitly flagged for review by the host server.

Just like pre-execute hooks, post-execute hooks are sandboxed and subject to the same
[Execution Contract](/docs/hooks/contract). The only exception is their ability to perform outbound network
requests, which is otherwise disallowed in Echo’s hook environment.
