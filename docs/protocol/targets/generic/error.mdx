# Generic Error Message

This structure defines the format for all generic error messages returned by the server when an action fails or encounters a problem. All error responses use the `error` target and `error` action. They include the original client-sent message as context and a descriptive message string.

## Overview

Any target or action combination is able to return the following errors when appropriate.

| Message             | Description                                                       | Possible Causes                                                |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `malformed-payload` | The payload was missing required fields or had invalid structure. | Client sent an incomplete or incorrectly formatted payload.    |
| `rate-limited`      | Too many sign-in attempts have been made in a short period.       | Repeated sign-in attempts triggered server-side rate limiting. |
| `payload-too-large` | Data exceeds allowed size                                         | Oversized blob or excessively long inputs                      |
| `internal-error`    | Failed to apply update                                            | Unexpected server-side failure                                 |

Additionally, on actions marked with <Authenticated />, the following errors can be raised when appropriate.

| Message         | Description                                   | Possible Causes                                           |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `not-signed-in` | Cannot perform action without active session. | The user attempted to sign out without an active session. |
