# `rep-add`

Adds a new signed public reputation remark to another user. This is used to signal positive, negative, or neutral trust toward a given user identity.

## Overview

This action allows clients to append a new reputation remark to another user's public reputation history. All remarks are signed using the sender's signing key and are publicly visible. This feature provides a decentralized way to evaluate trustworthiness over time.

| `invalid-signature` | The remark's signature could not be verified.            | The `sig` field is missing, malformed, or does not match the remark payload. |
| `invalid-target`    | The specified target user is invalid or unknown.         | The `usr` field refers to a nonexistent or malformed public key.             |
| `duplicate-remark`  | A remark from this sender to this target already exists. | The sender has previously submitted a remark for this user.                  |

## Notes

- Reputation remarks are immutable and must be signed before submission.
- Servers may throttle or reject submissions that appear spammy or malicious.
- Only one remark per user per sender is allowed. Submitting another will overwrite the old one.
