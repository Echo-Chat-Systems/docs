<Authenticated />

# `signout`

Ends the user's current authenticated session. This action should be called when the user explicitly chooses to log out. It invalidates the current session token or authentication context, requiring a new signin process for further access.

## Client → Server

```json Example
{
    "target": "auth",
    "data": {
        "action": "signout",
        "params": {}
    }
}
```

> This action has no parameters.

---

## Server → Client

In the event the signout completes, A [generic acknowledgment](/docs/protocol/targets/generic/acknowledge) is sent to the client.
If the signout fails the appropriate [error message](/docs/protocol/targets/generic/error) is sent.

## Notes
- This only affects the **current connection** or session context.
- No permanent user data is deleted or modified.
- Servers broadcast a `session-ended` postie event for status updates.
