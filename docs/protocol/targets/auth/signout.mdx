# `signout`

Ends the user's current authenticated session. This action should be called when the user explicitly chooses to log out. It invalidates the current session token or authentication context, requiring a new signin process for further access.

## Client → Server

{
    "target": "auth",
    "data": {
        "action": "signout",
        "params": {}
    }
}
```

> This action has no parameters.

## Server → Client
