# Protocol Overview

Welcome to the protocol documentation for the real-time communication system behind the application. This protocol defines how clients and servers exchange data using a combination of **WebSocket** and **REST** APIs.

## What This API Does

The protocol is the foundation for a real-time, secure, and privacy-focused messaging platform. It enables:

- Cryptographic authentication using Ed25519 keys (no usernames, passwords, or emails)
- End-to-end encrypted group messaging using [Messaging Layer Security (MLS)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9420)
- Live data delivery via a pub-sub system (`postie`)
- Lightweight, per-user settings and reputation systems
- Future federation support via shared identity models

## WebSocket Message Format

All messages sent via WebSocket follow a consistent envelope structure.

<SchemaExample path="/comms/basic-message.json">
```json
{
    "target": "messages",
    "data": {
        "action": "send",
        "params": {}
    }
}
```
</SchemaExample>

> This schema defines the structure for all messages sent over WebSocket. It enforces:
> - A top-level `target` string field
> - A `data` object containing an `action` and a `params` object
> - All action names and targets are **dash-separated**

## REST API Format

While most functionality is WebSocket-based, some large-payload operations (e.g., media uploads, encrypted blob storage)
use REST. These endpoints are documented in the [REST API section](/docs/protocol/rest/).

## Protocol Design Principles

### Modular Targets

All WebSocket actions are grouped into **targets**, each representing a logical category of functionality. This improves modularity and simplifies handler logic.

### Cryptographic Identity

There are no passwords or emails. Identity is tied to cryptographic key pairs:

- **Ed25519**: Persistent user identity and authentication
- **RSA**: Used for optional encryption and planned federation

### Transparent End-to-End Encryption

Group messaging channels use **Messaging Layer Security (MLS)** transparently. Each channel maintains a commit stream for MLS state updates. Clients only decrypt messages if they are valid group participants.

### Pub-Sub System (`postie`)

The `postie` target enables real-time updates through a pub-sub architecture. This includes:

- Status notifications
- Channel update broadcasts
- Typing indicators and ephemeral state

### Message Size & Boundaries

WebSocket payloads are kept lightweight (typically under 1 MB). Media and file transfer are handled exclusively through the REST API to preserve performance.

### Encrypted State Storage

User metadata (settings, preferences, etc.) is stored as an **encrypted blob**, retrievable using the `users/get-self` action. This ensures privacy and demonstrates advanced crypto handling.

## How to Use This Documentation

Use the sidebar to navigate protocol **targets**. Each target has its own page, and all actions are broken out into subpages.

This documentation covers all communications between the client and server. For sake of organisational sanity, pages are
organised from the perspective of incoming actions to the server unless explicit stated otherwise. This also means that
responses to atomic client actions are covered in their respective pages.
