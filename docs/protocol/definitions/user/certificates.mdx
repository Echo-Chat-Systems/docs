# User Certificates

User certificates are a core part of identity in the protocol. They are standardized JSON structures that encapsulate
a user’s identity, cryptographic keys, and trust signals. There are **two main forms of user certificate**:

- **User-signed certificate**  
This certificate is generated and signed by the user themselves using their private signing key. It asserts the
authenticity of their public keys and profile data. Its primary role is to give other parties a verifiable statement
of "this is who I am" that can be validated without trusting a server.

- **Server-signed certificate**  
This certificate is issued by a server the user is interacting with. It is signed with the server’s private signing key
and contains additional information such as reputation standing and origin server information on top of the existing
information in the user-signed cert.

This allows servers to vouch for users in their ecosystem and to impose validity limits
(for example, expiring certificates or revoking trust when a user is banned).

Both types of certificate use the **same underlying user structures**, ensuring consistency in how clients and servers
interpret identity. The only difference lies in *who signs the certificate* and what authority that signature conveys.

## User-Signed Certificate

The structure below defines the user signed certificate.

<SchemaExample path="/definitions/user/user-cert.json">
```json Example
{
    "keys": { ... },
    "profile": { ... },
    "sig": "UVcgO3slODkwcipodmtXaVJBWndxbFxv"
}
```
</SchemaExample>

<ParamsList>
    <Param name="keys" type="object" required>
        User [public keys](/protocol/definitions/crypto/keys.mdx#pubkeys).
        These allow others to verify signatures and encrypt messages to the user.
    </Param>

    <Param name="profile" type="object" required>
        User [profile](/docs/protocol/definitions/user/data#profile-structure).
        Contains human-readable metadata such as display name, avatar, and other optional details.
    </Param>

    <Param name="sig" type="string" required>
        Signature of the package without the `sig` key.
    </Param>
</ParamsList>


## Server-Signed User Certificate

<SchemaExample path="/definitions/user/server-cert.json">
```json Example
{
    "origin": {  ...  },
    "keys": { ... },
    "profile": { ... },
    "rep": {  ...  },
    "sig": "UVcgO3slODkwcipodmtXaVJBWndxbFxv"
}
```
</SchemaExample>

<ParamsList>
    <Param name="origin" type="object" required>
        User [origin server details](/protocol/definitions/origin.mdx).
    </Param>

    <Param name="keys" type="object" required>
        User [public keys](/protocol/definitions/crypto/keys.mdx#pubkeys).
    </Param>

    <Param name="profile" type="object" required>
        User [profile](/docs/protocol/definitions/user/data#profile-structure).
        Contains human-readable metadata such as display name, avatar, and other optional details.
    </Param>

    <Param name="rep" type="object" required>
        User public [reputation](/docs/protocol/definitions/user/reputation#rep-object) record.
    </Param>

    <Param name="sig" type="string" required>
        Signature of the package without the `sig` key.
    </Param>
</ParamsList>
