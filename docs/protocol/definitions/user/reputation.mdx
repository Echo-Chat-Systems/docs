# User Reputation

The reputation system is a **community self-moderation mechanism** built around **signed remarks**. Each user may issue feedback about other users by signing a `remark` object, which is stored under the target user's public record.

---

## Remark Structure

Each remark is a JSON object **signed by its issuer**. A single remark looks like this:

Each remark **must be signed** using the issuer's signing key. The hash of the remark and its signature is used as the unique `sig` key.


<SchemaExample path="/definitions/user/reputation/remark.json">
```json Example
{
    "sig": "bSNvOjhOUjVGYS4lKyNqUEpJeURBWQ==",
    "direction": 1,
    "user": "M2NMU0ovaWUpN2ZxIjRmWC5AUVpiWA==",
    "comment": "Great user, very helpful!",
    "timestamp": "2025-07-25 20:19:53"
}
```
</SchemaExample>

<ParamsList>
    <Param name="sig" type="string" required>
        The actual signature value of the remark as calculated by the user.
    </Param>

    <Param name="dir" type="int" required>
        Direction of the remark. `1` = positive, `-1` = negative, `0` = neutral.
    </Param>

    <Param name="com" type="string" required>
        A short comment explaining the remark. Optional.
    </Param>

    <Param name="usr" type="string" required>
        The public signing key of the user who issued the remark.
    </Param>

    <Param name="timestamp" type="string" required>
        The date and time the remark was made.
    </Param>
</ParamsList>

## Rep Object

A user’s `rep` object contains both a `points` tally and a set of signed remarks. The `remarks` are stored in a flat JSON object, using the **remark's signature** as the key:

<SchemaExample path="/definitions/user/reputation/rep.json">
```json Example
{
    "points": 100,
    "remarks": [
        {
            "sig": "bSNvOjhOUjVGYS4lKyNqUEpJeURBWQ==",
            "direction": 1,
            "user": "M2NMU0ovaWUpN2ZxIjRmWC5AUVpiWA==",
            "comment": "Great user, very helpful!"
        },
        {
            "sig": "RXI0TVMkTTtCYE5pLVh+SFlLbWA9RE5e",
            "direction": -1,
            "user": "dDMtMlRheyVPWS9FV15nOEAuXHNCNy1s",
            "comment": "Had a bad experience, would not recommend."
        }
    ]

}
```
</SchemaExample>

## Rules for Modification

- **Servers must never remove or modify remarks.**
- **Only the original issuer** (`usr`) of a remark may revoke or replace it.
- All changes to remarks must be cryptographically signed and verified.
- This ensures transparency, accountability, and user control.

---

## Reputation Score

The `points` field is a cached integer representing the **net sum** of all directional values (`dir`) in the `remarks`. It exists for convenience and fast UI rendering but **must not be treated as authoritative**.

Clients may choose to calculate the actual score from `remarks` to verify correctness.

---

## Social Function

Reputation is not just a number — it's a **living social record** of how a user is viewed by their peers. This empowers community-driven moderation without requiring centralized bans or hidden reports.
