# Media System

Echo-Chat defines a unified, minimal media architecture that supports **images**, **videos**, and **files** through a
consistent REST-based access model. Everything from emoji to message attachments flows through this system.

## Media Types

All media objects in Echo-Chat fall into one of three broad categories:

| Type  | Description                                                 |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Image | Static or animated pictures (e.g., PNG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP)    |
| Video | Time-based visual media (e.g., MP4, WEBM)                   |
| File  | Arbitrary binary blobs, including documents, archives, etc. |

Internally, these are all handled the same way—with a **Snowflake ID**, an associated **MIME type**, and metadata.
Whether you’re sending a selfie, a sticker, or a ZIP file, it’s just a media object.

## What Uses Media?

The media system backs **everything** that involves user-uploaded data:

- **Custom emojis**
- **Stickers**
- **User avatars and banners**
- **Guild icons and splash images**
- **Message attachments**
- **Embedded images/videos**

There’s no parallel system—if it’s binary, it goes through media.

## Access Pattern

All media is accessed **via REST**, not WebSocket. This is deliberate.

- WebSockets are reserved for fast, low-volume messaging and state sync.
- Media, on the other hand, often involves megabytes of payload, cache headers, range requests, and CDN handling—classic REST territory.

Every piece of media is assigned a **Snowflake ID** on upload. That ID is globally unique and timestamped, and can
be used directly to retrieve the file:

```http request
GET https://media.echo-chat.au/:snowflake
```

For example:

```http request
GET https://media.echo-chat.au/910244598304374981
```

Returns the raw file stream, along with appropriate headers (Content-Type, Content-Disposition, etc).

The media server or gateway may handle additional logic:

- Byte-range requests
- Expiry or quarantine flags
- Authorization (e.g. only certain users can access certain media)
- Content-type inference or override

## Why Not Inline Media?

In short: **size, caching, and control**.

Embedding base64 or blob content in message payloads would explode WebSocket sizes and complicate caching and storage.
By separating media out and addressing it via Snowflake IDs, we get:

- Small messages
- Reuse and deduplication
- Efficient client-side caching
- Easy CDN integration

## Uploading Media

Media uploads are also REST-based. Clients send the file, get back a Snowflake ID, and then use that ID wherever needed (e.g., in a message payload or emoji definition).

Uploads must specify:

- Content-Type
- File body
- Optional metadata (e.g. filename, dimensions)

The upload endpoint returns a Snowflake and any derived metadata the server has calculated (e.g. image dimensions, duration, etc).

This model keeps the protocol lean, consistent, and predictable—whether you’re adding a reaction or streaming a video. Everything binary is media. Everything media is REST.
