# Identifier Design

In designing Echo-Chat as a distributed, open protocol, one of the foundational decisions we faced was the format
and generation strategy for unique identifiers. This document walks through the reasoning and trade-offs that
led us to adopt a custom Snowflake-based ID scheme.

## Existing Formats

Everyone agrees: **sequential IDs are a non‑starter for modern, web‑scale systems.**
They’re like incrementing invoice numbers on a single‑threaded spreadsheet—fine for a hobby blog, a nightmare once you
introduce concurrency, sharding, or public scrutiny. Why?

- **Global lock‑in.** One database (or a heavyweight coordinator) has to hand out the next number. No coordinator, no guarantee.
- **Information leakage.** Your analytics are hanging out for anyone to see: create two messages, the IDs differ by 2, so… two new messages ever? A million? Instant privacy leak.
- **Hot‑spot indices.** Every write lands in the same part of a B‑tree, choking performance.
Databases can spread the pain, but you still pay in latch contention and cache pressure.

So if sequential IDs are Flagrant Foul, #1, surely the antidote is **UUIDs**, right?

> “They’re random! They’re unique! Problem solved…”

Not quite. UUIDs introduce their own, sneakier trade‑offs:

| Trait               | Sounds Good…                  | …Until You Realize                                                                                        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Uniqueness**      | No central authority needed.  | True—but now you’ve traded coordination for 128 bits of entropy you have to store, transmit, and index.   |
| **Random ordering** | Avoids hot‑spots.             | True—**too** random. Indices lose locality, range scans fragment, cache lines miss.                       |
| **Opaque**          | No info leak.                 | Also no *ordering* info. You can’t sort by creation time without a secondary column or query on metadata. |
| **Standardized**    | Drop‑in libraries everywhere. | Sure… and every ID is a 36‑character string that bloats URLs, logs, and front‑end payloads.               |

In short, **UUIDs fix the “global coordination” headache, only to hand you “oversized, unsortable identifiers” in exchange.**
That trade‑off matters:

- APIs ship larger JSON bodies.
- Databases work harder to keep random keys clustered.
- Clients sort on a separate timestamp field (and hope it’s indexed).

Which brings us to Snowflakes—the middle ground that preserves ordering, stays compact, and still keeps every node independent. (See the next section for how we implement them in Echo‑Chat.)

## Enter Snowflakes

Snowflake IDs, popularized by Twitter, are 64-bit integers that combine:

- A timestamp
- A machine ID
- A sequence number

They are designed to be:

- **Globally unique** without coordination
- **Roughly ordered by time**
- **Compact** and efficiently indexable
- **Relatively opaque** to users

## Echo-Chat’s Custom Snowflake Implementation

Echo-Chat uses a custom 64-bit Snowflake implementation tailored to our protocol’s needs:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="v1" label="V1">
        | Bit(s) | Name              | Description                                                  |
        |--------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
        | 44     | Timestamp         | Milliseconds since custom epoch (ensures temporal ordering)  |
        | 16     | Sequence          | Per-node counter to resolve collisions in the same ms        |
        | 4      | Snowflake Version | Identifies the version of the snowflake specification in use |

        SnowflakeV1 is designed as the jumping off point for a simple single-executable server.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Custom Epoch

We use a custom epoch (e.g. `2025-01-01T00:00:00Z`) to ensure our timestamp fits cleanly within 41 bits for decades.

### Benefits in Echo-Chat

- **Chronological sortability**: Snowflakes reflect creation time.
- **Decentralized safety**: Each node generates unique IDs without needing a master server.
- **Low storage cost**: A single 64-bit integer is far more efficient than UUIDs.
- **Compact representation**: Easy to store, log, and display.

### Notes

- IDs are directly represented as numeric values.
- If two IDs are compared numerically, the one with the lower value was created first.

## Conclusion

Echo-Chat's Snowflake system offers a pragmatic balance between coordination-free distributed ID generation and
practical sorting, indexing, and representation. It plays a foundational role in enabling our open,
decentralized architecture.
