# Basic WebSocket Message Format

This document defines the core structure used for all WebSocket communications in the protocol. It is intentionally simple, composable, and designed for long-term maintainability and clarity.

## Overview

All messages exchanged between the client and server—regardless of direction or intent—follow a consistent and predictable shape.
This enables streamlined validation, clear routing, and future architectural flexibility (e.g., microservices).

At the highest level, messages are JSON objects with the following structure:

<SchemaExample path="/comms/basic-message.json">
```json Example
{
    "target": "users",
    "data": {
        "action": "get",
        "params": {
            "id": "5eVuMCsPe53zQPLfDZHyaSMPaNWWsoiZ4XYXZ35J8sQj"
        }
    }
}
```
</SchemaExample>

<ParamsList>
    <Param name="target" type="string" required>
        Top-level namespace (e.g., `auth`, `users`, `channels`) used for routing.
    </Param>
    <Param name="action" type="string" required>
        The specific action being performed (e.g., `signup`, `get-profile`).
    </Param>
    <Param name="params" type="object" required>
        Payload specific to the given action.
    </Param>
</ParamsList>

## Design Considerations

The message format was designed to fulfill several long-term and operational goals:

### 1. **Clean Routing**
- Every message is unambiguously directed by the `target`.
- This allows each subsystem (or future microservice) to independently validate and respond to its own messages.

### 2. **Simple Validation**
- Each `target/action` pair corresponds to a known request/response schema.
- Makes it easy to enforce strict validation and reject malformed messages early.

### 3. **High Readability**
- The three-layer format (`target`, `action`, `params`) is easy to scan and reason about.
- Consistency across every message improves debugging and developer UX.

### 4. **Microservice-Ready**
- In a horizontally scalable architecture, messages can be forwarded directly to services based on their `target`.
- The format remains stable and self-contained even in distributed environments.

### 5. **Reduced Ambiguity**
- No magic keys, overloaded fields, or positional parameters.
- Explicit separation of routing (`target`), behavior (`action`), and content (`params`).

## Notes

- Future extensions to the protocol (e.g., metadata, versioning) can be introduced non-destructively.
