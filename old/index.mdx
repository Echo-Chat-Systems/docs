# Welcome to Echo-Chat

_Echo-Chat_ is a fully open-source, decentralized real-time messaging protocol and reference application stack. Built
with privacy, freedom, and extensibility in mind, Echo-Chat enables anyone to host their own chat server, build custom
clients, or contribute new ideas to the core protocol‚Äîwithout needing permission from a central authority.

This documentation hub is your gateway to understanding how Echo-Chat works from the ground up, and how you can extend
or build on top of it.

## Why Echo-Chat?

Modern chat applications often rely on closed platforms, opaque architectures, and centralized infrastructure. Echo-Chat is different:

- **Open Source**: Every layer of the system‚Äîfrom the WebSocket protocol to the UI‚Äîis open and auditable.
- **Decentralized**: Each Echo-Chat server is a sovereign instance, capable of interop with others, or operating in isolation if desired.
- **Client-Agnostic**: Clients interact with servers via a clear, schema-driven WebSocket protocol. There is no vendor lock-in.
- **Privacy First**: No global user identifiers, emails, or phone numbers. All authentication is cryptographic.
- **Designed for Extendability**: Future-proof and modular. You can build custom bots, moderation tools, or entire new interfaces.

## How the Protocol Works

Echo-Chat is built around a concise and highly structured **WebSocket protocol**. Clients and servers exchange messages
in a predictable, schema-validated format.

Each message sent over the wire follows a universal structure:

```json
{
  "target": "string",
  "data": {
    "action": "string",
    "params": {}
  }
}
```

This format ensures:

- **Clean parsing logic** on both client and server sides.
- **Microservice-friendly** design, where messages can be routed and processed by subsystems or worker pools.
- **Readable and debuggable** communication for developers.
- **Expandable** namespaces for future actions and feature sets.

For a full breakdown of the message format, see [Basic WS Message Format](/protocol/format.mdx).

## Decentralization Philosophy

Echo-Chat doesn‚Äôt rely on a central authority to define usernames, verify identities, or store your data. Instead:

- **Users are identified by public keys**, not usernames.
- **Servers can issue optional signed attestations** (certificates) to track reputations or verify user info.
- **User settings and customisations are stored client-side**, optionally uploaded as encrypted blobs.
- **Federation is opt-in**‚Äîyou choose whether your server communicates with others or remains isolated.

This approach lets communities, organizations, and individuals choose the level of autonomy and privacy they want.

## Components You Can Build

Echo-Chat is not just a reference implementation. It‚Äôs a **platform**. You can build:

- ‚úÖ **Custom clients** (desktop, mobile, terminal-based, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Alternate servers** with custom logic, moderation, or federation models
- ‚úÖ **Middleware** for bots, logging, analytics, or anti-abuse
- ‚úÖ **Gateways and bridges** to other chat systems
- ‚úÖ **Tooling** for admins or end-users

All of this is enabled by a stable, transparent, schema-validated protocol.

## Start Exploring the Protocol

To begin implementing your own Echo-Chat-compatible tool or service, head over to the [Protocol Reference](/protocol). You‚Äôll find:

- üìú Message schemas
- ‚ö° Action definitions
- üîê Authentication flows
- üí¨ Messaging and channel systems
- üë• User profiles and reputation

Everything is documented with detailed examples, tables, and validation rules.

## Contribution & Community

Echo-Chat thrives on transparency and collaboration. Contributions are welcomed to all parts of the client(s), server, documentation, and protocol.

Whether you're building your own client or helping improve the spec, your input shapes the future of decentralized communication.

## Summary

Echo-Chat is more than a chat app. It‚Äôs a protocol for **freedom-respecting**, **verifiable**, and **modular**
real-time communication. Whether you're hosting your own private network or building interoperable software,
Echo-Chat gives you the foundation to do it right‚Äîwith full control.
