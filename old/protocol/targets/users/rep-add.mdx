# `rep-add`

Adds a new signed public reputation remark to another user. This is used to signal positive, negative, or neutral trust toward a given user identity.

## Overview

This action allows clients to append a new reputation remark to another user's public reputation history. All remarks are signed using the sender's signing key and are publicly visible. This feature provides a decentralized way to evaluate trustworthiness over time.

- Servers may throttle or reject submissions that appear spammy or malicious.
- Only one remark per user per sender is allowed. Submitting another will overwrite the old one.
