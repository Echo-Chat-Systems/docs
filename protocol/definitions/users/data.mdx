# User Data Representations

This page defines the various structured forms in which user data may appear across the protocol. Depending on context,
a user may be represented in a **profile**, as a **public-user**, or as a **private-user** with full internal data.

---

## `profile`

A user profile is a broadcast structure typically attached guild membership or public presence.

        },
        "tag": {
            "type": "integer"
        },
        "pronouns": {

        },

            "format": "uri"
        },
        "timezone": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "status": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "type": {
                    "description": "test",
                    "type": "string"
                },
                "text": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "type",
                "text"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

This form **does not include any identifiers** like keys or internal user IDs. It's purely decorative and user-controlled.

---

## `public-user`

This structure is used when the system needs to share a verified user identity with others, such as message authors, guild owners, or moderators.

```json
{
    "origin": {  ...  },
    "keys": {  ...  },
    "profile": {  ...  },
    "rep": {  ...  },
}
```

References:
- [`origin`](/protocol/definitions/meta/origin)
- `keys` is [`pubkeys`](/protocol/definitions/crypto/keys#pubkeys)
- [`profile`](#)
- [`rep`](/protocol/definitions/users/reputation#rep-object)


This representation is visible to all clients and safe for sharing.

---

## `private-user`

The internal structure for a logged-in user, visible only to the user and the server. Includes sensitive fields like settings.

```json
{
    "origin": {  ...  },
    "keys": {  ...  },
    "profile": {  ...  },
    "rep": {  ...  },
    "settings": ""
}
```

This form should never be shared directly with other clients.

## üß¨ Key Differences

| Representation | Includes Profile | Includes Keys | Includes Settings | Visibility        |
|----------------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `profile`      | ‚úÖ                | ‚ùå             | ‚ùå                 | Public everywhere |
| `public-user`  | ‚úÖ                | ‚úÖ             | ‚ùå                 | Public API usage  |
| `private-user` | ‚úÖ                | ‚úÖ             | ‚úÖ                 | Internal/private  |

<Note>üìå Notes</Note>

- All user objects must include `pubkeys` in any authenticated or signed context.
- The `settings` object is an E2EE user-controlled blob.
- Profiles are expected to be customizable, with potential for federation in future revisions.
