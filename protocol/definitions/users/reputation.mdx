# User Reputation

The reputation system is a **community self-moderation mechanism** built around **signed remarks**. Each user may issue feedback about other users by signing a `remark` object, which is stored under the target user's public record.

---

## Remark Structure

Each remark is a JSON object **signed by its issuer**. A single remark looks like this:

<CodeGroup>
```json Example
{
    "sig": {
        "dir": 1,
        "com": "Helpful in tech support.",
        "usr": "pubkey-of-issuer"
    }
}
```
```json Schema
{
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
    "$id": "/static/schemas/user/reputation/remark.json",
    "title": "User Reputation Remark Schema",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "/": {}
    },
    "patternProperties": {
        "^.*$": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "direction": {
                    "type": "integer",
                    "minimum": -1,
                    "maximum": 1
                },
                "user": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "format": "base64"
                },
                "comment": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "direction",
                "user"
            ]
        }
    },
    "examples": [
        {
            "bSNvOjhOUjVGYS4lKyNqUEpJeURBWQ==": {
                "direction": 1,
                "user": "M2NMU0ovaWUpN2ZxIjRmWC5AUVpiWA==",
                "comment": "Great user, very helpful!"
            }
        },
        {
            "RXI0TVMkTTtCYE5pLVh+SFlLbWA9RE5e": {
                "direction": -1,
                "user": "dDMtMlRheyVPWS9FV15nOEAuXHNCNy1s",
                "comment": "Had a bad experience, would not recommend."
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Fields

| Field | Type           | Description                                                              |
|-------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sig` | `string`       | The actual signature value of the remark as calculated by the user.      |
| `dir` | `-1 \| 0 \| 1` | Direction of the remark. `1` = positive, `-1` = negative, `0` = neutral. |
| `com` | `string`       | A short comment explaining the remark. Optional.                         |
| `usr` | `string`       | The public signing key of the user who issued the remark.                |

Each remark **must be signed** using the issuer's signing key. The hash of the remark and its signature is used as the unique `sig` key.

---

## Rep Object

A user’s `rep` object contains both a `points` tally and a set of signed remarks. The `remarks` are stored in a flat JSON object, using the **remark's signature** as the key:

<CodeGroup>
```json Example
{
    "rep": {
        "points": 100,
        "remarks": {
            "b2a1f...": {
                "dir": 1,
                "com": "Great community help.",
                "usr": "abc123..."
            },
            "e3d8c...": {
                "dir": -1,
                "com": "Spammed a channel.",
                "usr": "xyz456..."
            }
        }
    }
}
```
```json Schema
{
    "title": "Reputation Information Schema",
    "$id": "/static/schemas/user/reputation/rep.json",
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
    "type": "object",
    "required": [
        "points",
        "remarks"
    ],
    "properties": {
        "points": {
            "type": "integer"
        },
        "remarks": {
            "type": "object",
            "$ref": "/static/schemas/user/reputation/remark.json"
        }
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Rules for Modification

- **Servers must never remove or modify remarks.**
- **Only the original issuer** (`usr`) of a remark may revoke or replace it.
- All changes to remarks must be cryptographically signed and verified.
- This ensures transparency, accountability, and user control.

---

## Reputation Score

The `points` field is a cached integer representing the **net sum** of all directional values (`dir`) in the `remarks`. It exists for convenience and fast UI rendering but **must not be treated as authoritative**.

Clients may choose to calculate the actual score from `remarks` to verify correctness.

---

## Social Function

Reputation is not just a number — it's a **living social record** of how a user is viewed by their peers. This empowers community-driven moderation without requiring centralized bans or hidden reports.
