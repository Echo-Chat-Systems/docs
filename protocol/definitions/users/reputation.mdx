# 🌟 User Reputation

The reputation system is a **community self-moderation mechanism** built around **signed remarks**. Each user may issue feedback about other users by signing a `remark` object, which is stored under the target user's public record.

---

## Remark Structure

Each remark is a JSON object **signed by its issuer**. A single remark looks like this:

```json
{
    "dir": 1,
    "com": "Helpful in tech support.",
    "usr": "pubkey-of-issuer"
}
```

### 🔍 Field Definitions

| Field | Type     | Description                                               |
|-------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `dir` | `-1      | 0                                                         | 1` | Direction of the remark. `1` = positive, `-1` = negative, `0` = neutral. |
| `com` | `string` | A short comment explaining the remark. Optional.          |
| `usr` | `string` | The public signing key of the user who issued the remark. |

Each remark **must be signed** using the issuer's signing key. The hash of the remark and its signature is used as the unique `sig` key.

## Rep Object

A user’s `rep` object contains both a `points` tally and a set of signed remarks. The `remarks` are stored in a flat JSON object, using the **remark's signature** as the key:

```json
{
    "rep": {
        "points": 100,
        "remarks": {
            "b2a1f...": {
                "dir": 1,
                "com": "Great community help.",
                "usr": "abc123..."
            },
            "e3d8c...": {
                "dir": -1,
                "com": "Spammed a channel.",
                "usr": "xyz456..."
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 🛑 Rules for Modification

- 🚫 **Servers must never remove or modify remarks.**
- ✅ **Only the original issuer** (`usr`) of a remark may revoke or replace it.
- 🔒 All changes to remarks must be cryptographically signed and verified.
- ✨ This ensures transparency, accountability, and user control.

---

## 📊 Reputation Score

The `points` field is a cached integer representing the **net sum** of all directional values (`dir`) in the `remarks`. It exists for convenience and fast UI rendering but **must not be treated as authoritative**.

Clients may choose to calculate the actual score from `remarks` to verify correctness.

## 🤝 Social Function

Reputation is not just a number — it's a **living social record** of how a user is viewed by their peers. This empowers community-driven moderation without requiring centralized bans or hidden reports.
