# User Identity

This page outlines how users are uniquely identified in the protocol, and the reasoning behind using cryptographic keys instead of traditional identifiers such as usernames or passwords.

Required knowledge:
- [Keys](/protocol/definitions/crypto/keys.mdx)

## Identity Through Public Keys

Each user is uniquely identified by their [`sk`](/protocol/definitions/crypto/keys.mdx#signing-key). This key acts as their permanent identity on the network. When a user connects or interacts with the system, they prove control over this key by signing challenges or payloads.

This replaces the need for user IDs, usernames, or email addresses as a core identity mechanism.

## Why Not Use Emails or Usernames?

This system deliberately avoids email-password or username-password logins for several reasons:

### Decentralization

- There's no need for a central authority to issue or verify accounts.
- Users can generate their identity locally, even offline.

### Security

- Passwords are inherently weak — they can be reused, guessed, or leaked.
- Public-key auth ensures only the holder of the private key can act as a user.

### Privacy

- No personal information is required to create or use an identity.
- Even the server does not need to know who you "are" — just that you control your keys.

## Key Ownership = Identity

In this system, **identity is not what you know (a password)** — it’s **what you own** (a keypair).

If a user loses their private keys, they lose access to their identity and must start fresh. For this reason, secure client-side storage and optional key backup/export features are essential at the UI level.

## Summary

| Traditional Identity     | Cryptographic Identity        |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Email + Password         | Signing + Encryption Keys     |
| Centralized login server | Trustless, key-based auth     |
| Can be faked or stolen   | Tied to possession of keys    |
| Leaks personal info      | Preserves privacy             |

The result is a more secure, decentralized, and privacy-preserving identity model that aligns with the protocol’s design goals.
