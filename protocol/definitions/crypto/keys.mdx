# Cryptographic Keys

This page defines the terminology used throughout the documentation to refer to user identity and key cryptographic material.

All users in the system are identified and authenticated using cryptographic key pairs. These keys are central to user verification, end-to-end encryption, and identity management.

## Terms and Definitions

### `signing-key`

The user's **Ed25519** public key used to **verify signatures**. This key serves as the user's **identity** within the protocol.

**Referred to as `sk` for short.**

- Private portion is kept secure by the client.
- Public portion is distributed freely and used for verification.
- Used in signing WebSocket actions and verifying reputation statements.

### `encryption-key`

The user's **RSA** or public key used for various secure key exchanges and low security system messages.

**Referred to as `ek` for short**

- Private portion is stored alongside the [*signing-key*](#signing-key)
- Used to securely initiate a diffie-hellman key exchange.
- Used to broadcast system-messages to target users.
- Publicly advertised in the user's profile.

### `pubkeys`

The set of both public keys belonging to a user:

- `signing-key` (Ed25519)
- `encryption-key` (RSA)

The term `pubkeys` is used throughout the protocol to refer to this public key bundle.

{
    "sk": "BASE64/HEX_STRING",
    "ek": "BASE64/HEX_STRING"
}
```

    "properties": {
        "sk": {
            "type": "string",
            "format": "base64"
        },
        "ek": {
            "type": "string",
            "format": "base64"
        }
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>


### `keyset`

The full keyset owned by a user, including **both public and private keys**:

- `signing-key`: private + public (for identity and signature)
- `encryption-key`: private + public (for decryption)

The `keyset` must be **stored securely** on the client device and never transmitted to the server. Compromise of the `keyset` allows full account impersonation.

---

## Key Rotation

There is no circumstance where a user's [`pubkeys`](#pubkeys) can be rotated whatsoever. This is a deliberate design
decision meant to enforce security.

For this reason, it is absolutely **crucial** for users to store their keys in a secure, redundant fashion. A key handler
system has been implemented in [EchoLib](https://github.com/Echo-Chat-Systems/EchoLib) to securely store user keys in an
encrypted file locally.
