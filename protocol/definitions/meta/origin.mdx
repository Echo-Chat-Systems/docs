# 🌐 Origin

The `origin` object is a lightweight structure that describes **where** a piece of data or request **originated** from. While currently included for metadata and audit purposes, it is designed to support **future federation and multi-server communication**.

---

## 🧱 Structure

An origin has two fields:

<CodeGroup>
```json Example
{
    "host": "example.com",
    "port": 443
}
```
```json Schema
{
    "title": "Origin Information Schema",
    "$id": "/static/schemas/meta/origin.json",
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
    "type": "object",
    "required": [
        "host", "port"
    ],
    "properties": {
        "host": {
            "type": "string",
            "format": "url"
        },
        "port": {
            "type": "integer"
        }
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## 🧭 Purpose

While currently not validated or enforced in any strict way, the `origin` field:

- 📌 Marks the **source location** of a message or object
- 🌐 Prepares for **federated server-to-server communications**
- 🧩 May be used by moderation tools or diagnostic utilities

---

## 🛡️ Trust Model

At present, the `origin` field is **informational only** and should not be trusted unless:

- It is verified by a **trusted server signature**, or
- The enclosing object is part of a **signed and authenticated context**
