description: Signs the user out of the current session.

# `signout`

Ends the user's current authenticated session. This action should be called when the user explicitly chooses to log out. It invalidates the current session token or authentication context, requiring a new signin process for further access.

---

## Client → Server

```json Example
{
    "target": "auth",
    "data": {
        "action": "signout"
    }
}
```

> This action has no parameters.

---

## Server → Client

In the event the signout completes, the following message is sent to the client. If the signout fails the appropriate [error message](/protocol/targets/error) is sent.

```json Example
{
    "target": "auth",
    "data": {
        "action": "signout",
        "params": {
            "status": "ok"
        }
    }
}
```
