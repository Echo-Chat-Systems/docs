description: Signs the user out of the current session.

# ðŸ”“ `signout`

Ends the user's current authenticated session. This action should be called when the user explicitly chooses to log out. It invalidates the current session token or authentication context, requiring a new signin process for further access.

---

## ðŸ§­ Flow

1. The client sends a `signout` request to the `auth` target.
2. The server clears the associated session.
3. The server responds with confirmation.
4. Any further requests requiring authentication will be rejected until re-authentication.

## ðŸ“¤ Client â†’ Server

```json
{
    "target": "auth",
    "data": {
        "action": "signout"
    }

```

> This action has no parameters.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This only affects the **current connection** or session context.
- No permanent user data is deleted or modified.
- Servers may optionally broadcast a `session-ended` pubsub event if session tracking is implemented.
