# `get-self`

Retrieves the full profile of the currently authenticated user. This action does not require a user ID, as it infers identity from the current session or connection state.

## Overview

This action allows a client to retrieve all of their private user information. It is primarily used during client startup after authentication is complete, or when refreshing local user state.
