# `get-self`

Retrieves the full profile of the currently authenticated user. This action does not require a user ID, as it infers identity from the current session or connection state.

## Overview

This action allows a client to retrieve their own profile, including metadata such as public keys, display name, and account settings. It is primarily used during client startup after authentication is complete, or when refreshing local user state.
