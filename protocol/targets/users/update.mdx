# `update`

Updates the authenticated user's profile or settings. This action allows a user to modify any or all of their private user data
bar their keys.

## Overview

The `update` action is used by clients to persist profile or settings changes. Only the authenticated user can update their own information.
All changes are subject to server-side validation and may be rejected if invalid.
