# Protocol Overview

Welcome to the protocol documentation for the real-time communication system behind the application. This protocol defines how clients and servers exchange data using a combination of **WebSocket** and **REST** APIs.

## What This API Does

The protocol is the foundation for a real-time, secure, and privacy-focused messaging platform. It enables:

- Cryptographic authentication using Ed25519 keys (no usernames, passwords, or emails)
- End-to-end encrypted group messaging using [Messaging Layer Security (MLS)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9420)
- Live data delivery via a pub-sub system (`postie`)
- Lightweight, per-user settings and reputation systems
- Future federation support via shared identity models

## WebSocket Message Format

All messages sent via WebSocket follow a consistent envelope structure.

Instead of documenting the format inline, we define it in a reusable JSON Schema file:

```import /static/schemas/comms/basic-message.json```

> This schema defines the structure for all messages sent over WebSocket. It enforces:
> - A top-level \`target\` string field
> - A \`data\` object containing an \`action\` and a \`params\` object
> - All action names and targets are **dash-separated**

## REST API Format

While most functionality is WebSocket-based, some large-payload operations (e.g., media uploads, encrypted blob storage) use REST. These endpoints are documented in the [REST API section](/rest/index).

## Protocol Design Principles

### 🧭 Modular Targets

All WebSocket actions are grouped into **targets**, each representing a logical category of functionality. This improves modularity and simplifies handler logic.

### 🔐 Cryptographic Identity

There are no passwords or emails. Identity is tied to cryptographic key pairs:

- **Ed25519**: Persistent user identity and authentication
- **RSA**: Used for optional encryption and planned federation

### 🧪 Transparent End-to-End Encryption

Group messaging channels use **Messaging Layer Security (MLS)** transparently. Each channel maintains a commit stream for MLS state updates. Clients only decrypt messages if they are valid group participants.

### 📬 Pub-Sub System (`postie`)

The `postie` target enables real-time updates through a pub-sub architecture. This includes:

- Status notifications
- Channel update broadcasts
- Typing indicators and ephemeral state

### 📦 Message Size & Boundaries

WebSocket payloads are kept lightweight (typically under 1 MB). Media and file transfer are handled exclusively through the REST API to preserve performance.

### 🔐 Encrypted State Storage

User metadata (settings, preferences, etc.) is stored as an **encrypted blob**, retrievable using the `users/get-self` action. This ensures privacy and demonstrates advanced crypto handling.

## How to Use This Documentation

Use the sidebar to navigate protocol **targets**. Each target has its own page, and all actions are broken out into subpages.
